Exercise 1: Setting Up Java and Writing Your First Program

Write Your First Java Program:
Open your chosen IDE.
Create a new Java project and add a file named Main.java.
Write the following code in the Main.java file:
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
}
Run the program in your IDE.
Ensure that "Hello, World!" is displayed in the console.
