Exercise 2: Extending Your Java Skills

Add a New Class File:
Open the same Java project you created in Exercise 1.
Create a new file in your project directory and name it Book.java (or Student.java or Car.java or Avatar.java if you prefer).
Write a class to demonstrate Encapsulation. 
Update Your Main File:
Modify your Main.java file to use the Book (or Student) class. Add code to create objects, set their attributes, and call their methods.
