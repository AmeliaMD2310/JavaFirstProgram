Exercise 3: Using Constructors in Java

Objective: The goal of this exercise is to extend your Java skills by adding constructors to the Java program you created in Exercise 2. You will modify your Book.java (or Student.java, Car.java, or Avatar.java) class to include constructors for initializing objects. You will also update your Main.java file to demonstrate the use of constructors.
Add a Constructor to Your Class:

Open the Java project you created in Exercise 2.
In the Book.java (or your chosen class, like Student.java), add a constructor that allows initializing the class attributes.
Use both a no-argument constructor and a parameterized constructor to initialize objects of the class. The no-argument constructor should set default values, while the parameterized constructor should allow you to initialize objects with custom values.
For example, in Book.java, you can add the constructor like this:
Update Your Main File:

In the Main.java file, update your code to use both constructors:
Create objects using the no-argument constructor and the parameterized constructor.
Demonstrate setting values for attributes using the setters, and use getters to display values in your program.
